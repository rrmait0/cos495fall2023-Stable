# cos495fall2023-Stable
Marketplace App made for COS 495 project Fall 2023

Stables is a marketplace app where students on campus, or around campus,
can show products and service they offer. This was made to centralize a place
all of these can be shown together instead of having to search individually for such things.

Note - only the login screen was completed due to time constraints and limited programmers.
